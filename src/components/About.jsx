              Hi, I'm Billy — a web developer based in Australia. I started Onrai Studio because I kept seeing local businesses
              get burned by expensive agencies that over-promised and under-delivered. A plumber shouldn't need a six-month
              engagement and a $30,000 quote to have a decent website.
            </p>
            <p className="about__bio">
              I build fast, modern websites that are designed to get you found on Google and turn visitors into paying customers.
              I work with one client at a time where possible — so you always have my full attention, not an account manager
              who's juggling 40 projects.
            </p>
