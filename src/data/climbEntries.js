Google's quality checkers and real customers run exactly the same mental checklist when they land on a small business website. Who runs this? Where are they? How do I contact them? Is there anyone else on the internet who corroborates that they exist? If the answers aren't visible in the first few seconds, both the human and the algorithm move on.
