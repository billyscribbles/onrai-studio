For the public service area, add the actual suburbs or cities you serve — for us that's Melbourne and the surrounding metro suburbs, not every postcode in Victoria. Google is smart enough to surface you for nearby searches inside your stated area, and over-listing looks like spam. The honest, narrow answer outranks the greedy one almost every time.
