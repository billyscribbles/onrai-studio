Seven pages. That's enough. Your site probably has a similar handful. The temptation is to chase every keyword with a new URL — "Melbourne Web Design", "Melbourne AI Chatbots", "Melbourne SEO" — but on a small site that just creates ten thin pages Google ignores. One strong page with the right words beats ten weak copies. So instead of multiplying, we're sharpening what's already there.
